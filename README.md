# AuroraLD_Studio_Software
AuroraLD Studio is a ladder logic and SCADA software for Arduino and compatible boards with serial communication. This software has basic instructions for ladder programming and are similar to Studio 5000 from Rockwell Automation. It has been coded in Processing and is completely free. The purpose of the software is to help students learn about PLC programming and SCADA systems not only by simulation but also by implementing low cost projects using development boards like Arduino.
